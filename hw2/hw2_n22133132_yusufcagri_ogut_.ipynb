You will use logistic regression and support vector machine models to predict the type of dinosaur based on the provided information. In this assignment, you may utilize built-in libraries.

Stratification ensures that each CV fold maintains a similar distribution of class examples as the entire training set. You can design various experiments by selecting some/all information provided in the dataset. Here, we expect the best result you obtained after these experiments and observations.
